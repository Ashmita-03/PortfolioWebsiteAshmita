      <p>
        My very first photoshoot look, captured in a traditional half saree that beautifully blends grace, culture, and elegance. This moment reflects both my roots and the joy of experiencing the art of modeling for the first time.

        Onam is more than a festival, it’s a celebration of heritage, colors, and happiness. This photoshoot captures that spirit, with traditional attire bringing out the grace of the occasion and the festive mood shining through every frame
